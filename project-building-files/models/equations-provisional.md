# Equations — Provisional Set (Approximate / Construct / Partial / Missing)

> **The lower-confidence tier.** Everything here is *not* a settled physical law: order-of-magnitude fits (**Approximate**), modeling choices (**Construct**), assembled-from-pieces (**Partial**), or not-yet-existing (**Missing**). By living in *this* document rather than `equations-core.md`, an equation is structurally classified as provisional — the pipeline must propagate reduced confidence to any result that depends on it, and the render must shade it toward red/purple. This split is ADR-011. The confidence scale and color mapping are defined once in `schema-field-definition.md`.

Certainty ratings: **Approximate** · **Construct** (a defined modeling choice, tunable, not "true") · **Partial** (pieces exist; not fully assembled) · **Missing** (no equation yet).

## Core model constructs

| ID | Name | Form | Purpose | Certainty |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EQ-CORE-3` | Factor contribution | `ℓᵢ = signᵢ·wᵢ·Mᵢ·fᵢ(space)·gᵢ(t)` | Per-factor log-odds term | Construct |
| `EQ-CORE-4` | Confidence propagation | *(now defined — see below)* | Aggregate trustworthiness of a veil value → the blue/purple/red hue | Construct |

### `EQ-CORE-4` — Confidence propagation (newly defined)

Previously **Missing**; now specified as a defensible **Construct**. It answers: *how much should we trust the veil's height at this point and time?* — and its output drives the color.

**Step 1 — per-factor input confidence (weakest link).** A factor reads one or more entity fields, each with its own `confidence` (from `schema-field-definition.md` / the source field map). The factor's input confidence is the **minimum** over those fields (a factor is only as trustworthy as its least-certain input):
`c_input,i = min( confidence of each entity field factor i reads )`
*(Default per field, if absent: 0.10. Alternative to `min`: the product, for stricter multiplicative degradation — `min` is the conservative default.)*

**Step 2 — combined per-factor confidence.** Fold in the factor's own science-backing weight `wᵢ` (from `factors.md`):
`cᵢ = wᵢ · c_input,i`

**Step 3 — location confidence (magnitude-weighted mean).** Trust the veil value in proportion to how much of its log-odds comes from high-confidence factors:
`confidence_here = Σᵢ cᵢ·|ℓᵢ|  /  Σᵢ |ℓᵢ|`
*(If `Σ|ℓᵢ| = 0`, confidence is undefined → treat as low/baseline.)*

**Step 4 — render.** Map `confidence_here` onto the canonical blue(1.0)→purple(0.5)→red(0.0) hue scale (`schema-field-definition.md` §5). Height still comes from `H`; hue comes from `confidence_here`. Thus a **red result formed where a blue-certain input and a red-uncertain input combine** is exactly uncertainty propagating through the log-odds sum — the picture the user envisioned, now with math beneath it.

**Status:** Construct — the *method* is a defensible modeling choice, not a law; tunable (min vs product, weighting). It is defined and usable, no longer Missing.

## Remaining gaps (still Missing/Partial)

- `EQ-CHEM-3` (Partial), `EQ-CHEM-4` (Missing), `EQ-CHEM-5` (Missing), `EQ-HAZ-1` (Partial), `EQ-HAZ-3` (Partial), `EQ-ENERGY-1` (Partial). *(`EQ-CORE-4` is now resolved — moved from Missing to Construct/defined.)*

*Any equation here degrades the confidence of results that use it; that degradation is carried by the per-field/per-factor confidences and surfaced through `EQ-CORE-4` as red/purple shading.*
